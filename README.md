# AndroidBase

There are three branches:
* **library**: This is current branch for developing new feature, base or extension, then publish to JitPack via creating Git tag.
* **template**: Major branch for Gradle Kotlin DSL template that can be used by other developers.
* **gradle-kotlin-dsl**: Pure branch to demonstrate how to migrate from groovy to kotlin for gradle build system. Just like you create a whole new project from Android Studio, but in gradle kotlin DSL build file.
